# plantuml - a open source to draw UML's diagram

For the first time, I was asked to draw UML diagrams, specifically Activity Diagrams. However, because most tools for drawing UML are paid, I finally looked for free or open-source tools, and found **plantuml**. This tool is Java-based (.jar), very simple, and does not use a visual interface for drawing diagrams. Instead of dragging and dropping to draw UML diagrams, here we do coding, where the file extension code to be executed is called **.puml**.

Here's the address I used to get the plantuml tool: https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases . Download the file: **plantuml-1.2025.7.jar**. After that, I saved this file in the C:\plantuml\ folder --> just cut and paste.
